# Programmentwicklung 2 - Submission Repository

This repository contains the submissions for the course *Programmentwicklung 2*, which is part of the 3rd semester of Software Engineering at the University of Stuttgart, with 3 ECTS credits. My task was to create a Todo Planner using Vue.js for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MariaDB for the database, following specific requirements. There are four feedback files uploaded, where the last one builds upon the previous ones and was graded. The final grade I received for the project was 1.0 with 69/70 points, for more details see [feedback-ex4.md](feedback-ex4.md).
The code for the exercises is organized as follows:

## Directory Structure

- **/api**  
  The backend is located in the `/api` folder. For more details, see: [api](api/README.md)

- **/frontend**  
  The frontend is located in the `/frontend` folder. For more details, see: [frontend](frontend/README.md)

## How to Use the App

1. Clone this repository (https://github.com/DenizAltunkapan/todo-planner.git)
2. Install a JDK of at least version 21. Make sure Maven is installed. Install Node.js and ensure its root folder is added to your PATH.
3. Start the API by navigating to the backend folder and executing `mvn spring-boot:run`.
4. Then, start the frontend by navigating to its folder and running:
    - `npm install`
    - `npm run dev`
